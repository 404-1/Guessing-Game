# Guessing-Game
This is a Python-based guessing game where you can either guess the computer's number or let the computer try to guess yours.                                                                 
I made this game learning and trying to understand loops (while loops to be specific) and conditional statements.                                                                             
It's far from perfect or efficient but it does what I want, I guess.
